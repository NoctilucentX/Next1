**Web-Based Management System with Smart Scheduler and Resource Allocation for Sernan's Music Clinic **

The system aims to modernize clinic operations by providing a centralized platform for administrators, students, and instructors.
 
Developed using modern web technologies including Next.js, React, Firebase for backend services, and a suite of UI and styling tools such as Radix UI components (@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-slot, @radix-ui/react-tabs), Lucide React for icons, and Tailwind CSS along with its utilities (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, tailwindcss-animate), this system is expected to significantly enhance administrative efficiency, reduce scheduling conflicts, and provide valuable insights into resource utilization and financial performance. Evaluation will be based on ISO/IEC standards, focusing on functionality, usability, security, effectiveness, and ease of use. 



_This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project 
bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]
(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app)._
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) 
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
